To deploy your project for a demo view, you have a few options depending on your needs:

1. GitHub Pages: If you have created a static website, you can use GitHub Pages to host your site for free. Simply push your code to a GitHub repository, enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings, and select the branch you want to publish. Your website will then be available at `<username>.github.io/<repository-name>`.

2. Heroku: If your project requires a server, you can use Heroku to deploy and host your application. Heroku is a cloud platform that provides easy deployment, scaling, and management of applications. You can deploy your application by linking your GitHub repository to Heroku and configuring your deployment settings.

3. AWS Elastic Beanstalk: Similar to Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a cloud platform that allows you to deploy and manage your applications easily. You can deploy your application by creating an environment in AWS Elastic Beanstalk, linking your GitHub repository, and configuring your deployment settings.

Once you have deployed your project, you can share the link with others for demo view.

If you have already committed and pushed the changes to the remote Git repository, then you should be able to find all the files in your Git repository. You can clone the repository to your local machine if you want to work on the code locally. Here are the steps to clone a Git repository:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the Git repository.
3. Run the command `git clone <repository_url>` where `<repository_url>` is the URL of the remote repository.

Once the repository is cloned, you should be able to see all the files in the repository on your local machine.

Here are the steps to deploy your project on GitHub Pages:

1. First, make sure you have a GitHub account and have created a repository for your project.
2. Upload all of the project files to your GitHub repository.
3. Navigate to the "Settings" tab in your repository.
4. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section and select the branch you want to use as your publishing source (typically the "main" branch).
5. Choose the root directory as your source and click "Save".
6. Wait a few minutes for the deployment to complete, then click on the link provided in the "GitHub Pages" section to view your live demo.

That's it! Now your project is hosted on the internet and can be accessed by anyone with the link.
