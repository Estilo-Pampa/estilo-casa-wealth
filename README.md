Summary:

- We developed a web application using various programming languages and frameworks such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flask, and MongoDB.
- The application allows users to manage projects, assign tasks to team members, track time spent on tasks, and generate financial reports.
- We created a database schema to store project and task data, and wrote Python scripts to interact with the database and perform CRUD operations.
- We used Flask to create the web server and define routes for handling HTTP requests, and used JavaScript and CSS to create an interactive user interface.
- We implemented a self-regulating agile Scrum system to automatically assign tasks to idle team members based on previous project completion rates.
- We created a visual flowchart and stack diagram to visualize the different components of the application and how they interact.

Regarding the Git files, here are the steps you should follow:

1. Initialize a new Git repository in the root directory of your project by running the command `git init`.
2. Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude files and directories that should not be tracked by Git, such as virtual environments and log files.
3. Add all the files to the staging area by running the command `git add .`.
4. Commit the changes to the repository by running the command `git commit -m "Initial commit"`.
5. Create a new remote repository on GitHub or any other Git hosting service you prefer.
6. Add the remote repository URL as a remote to your local repository by running the command `git remote add origin <remote repository URL>`.
7. Push the local repository to the remote repository by running the command `git push -u origin main`.

That's it! Now your project files are version controlled and stored in a remote repository that you can access from anywhere.
